# Hey, I'm Andrew 👋

Building agentic AI products at [NeuralNexus](https://neuralnexus.lk) in Colombo. I lead product management and business development for multi-agent systems that can reason, plan, and execute complex tasks autonomously.

## What I do

I architect products where AI meets real business problems. Basically turning "what's possible with autonomous agents" into "what customers will pay for."

**Recent work:** Shipped 16 product concepts in 45 days across multiple domains using LLMs as my architecture partner. Built functional MVPs with Replit, V0, Lovable, Gemini CLI, and Claude Code.

## AI-Assisted Product Development

I'm exploring what happens when product managers use LLMs not just for code generation, but to learn solution architecture.

**What I've learned building with LLMs:**
- Data structure and architectural patterns
- Performance trade-offs and system design
- How to deliver clear technical blueprints, not vague specs
- The difference between prototype and production code

**My approach:**
- Structured LLM dialogue over random prompting
- Learn the "why" behind every solution
- Build working prototypes, validate with users
- Hand off clear specifications to production teams

## Impact

Using AI for product work has changed my output:
- PRDs in hours instead of weeks
- Same-day functional specifications
- Built a complete product conceptualization methodology while shipping projects
- 10x increase in concepts I can validate and architect

## Background

**Previous roles:**
- MillenniumIT ESP (2022-2025): Led business development and product for enterprise software. Shipped Nexusvision (digital banking), government education systems (UNICEF/WFP backed), and solutions for defense/transportation.
- SLASSCOM (2020-2022): Ran technology forums and organized AI Asia Summit 2021 (300+ attendees).
- HSBC (2014-2020): Digital transformation and ICT operations. Built automated messaging systems, saved LKR 16M through ATM optimization.

**Education:**
- Exec MSc in Information Security - Asia E-University
- BSc Psychology (Hons) - Coventry University

The psychology background helps with product work more than you'd expect.
